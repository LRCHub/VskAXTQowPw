You think you've got it all set up,
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm every girl you see
And play with everyone that you can

But I've got news for you,
I hope it won't hit you too hard
One of these days while you're at play
I'm gonna catch you off guard

I'm gonna tear your playhouse down, pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down, room by room

You think love is just fun and games
Trying to be a playboy
All you do is run around
Using hearts for play toys

You've been playing daddy, with every mama around
What you gonna say, when you look up one day
See your playhouse tumblin' down

I'm gonna tear your playhouse down, pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down, room by room, mmm
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down, room by room

The drops of rain they
fall all over
this awkward silence
makes me crazy
the glow inside burns
light upon her
I'll try to kiss you
if you let me
(this can't be the end)
Tidal waves they rip
right through me
tears from eyes worn
cold and sad
pick me up now
I need you so bad
Down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)

Your vows of silence
fall all over
the look in your eyes
makes me crazy
I feel the darkness
break upon her
I'll take you over
if you let me
(you did this)
Tidal waves they rip
right through me
tears from eyes worn
cold and sad
pick me up now
I need you so bad
Down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)

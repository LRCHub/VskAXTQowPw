Fraud, you're not a friend to me, a drag on society
A tool of bureaucracy and I can barely tolerate you fuckers around me
Nightstick to the fucking face, how does that shit fucking taste?
Just to survive is never enough, we need to call the bluff

Disarray in the nation, disarray degradation

Face down, face down, face down to the ground

Brutality against brutality, the real face of the enemy
Keep them pigs away from me, above of power and authority
Blacklisted calamity, forceful rape entity
Devils in uniform, you'll wish you were never born

Disarray in the nation, disarray degradation

Face down, face down, face down to the ground

Menace to society
Cop shoot cop mentality
A cancer of a broken land
Traitor to the common man
Invaders of your privacy
Nothing is sacred reality

Kill or be killed

Wrong it it, where this started
Wrong it is, from the beginning

Bleed from the eyes, rot from the inside out
Inverted skies hide in the underground
